Hello! I'm Farhan, and I like to build CAD systems, 3D experiences, and games. I have been working in the infrastructure software development industry as a developer, helping build plant and building design CAD systems, and later as a product and projects manager for a diverse range of products in the generative design, engineering simulation, and BIM space.

Here's just a little sampling of my personal projects I have worked on (or am working on). Not entirely related to the more serious stuff I just mentioned though...

🧀 **Cheddar:** I really don't know where I am going with this, but for now, just enjoy the cheese - https://farhan3d.github.io/mydude.github.io/

🤖 **Minotaur:** A fully rigged mech project in Unity, modeled in Blender. WIP, and hopefully will soon be up on the Unity Asset Store - https://farhan3d.github.io/minotaur/minotaur.html

🌺 **Four Tiles:** A small Unity based game I made for and launched on the Play Store. It is supposed to be a memory, reflexes, and focus challenger. The game gets progressively difficult to the point of almost being impossible beyond a certain level. How much can you score?  https://farhan3d.github.io/fourtiles/fourtiles.html

🎲 **Cubemash:** My first game ever I made back in 2016 for the Play Store. Tons of learning with this one, though it is far from polished. I was approached once by a leading game producer from China to help propel this project forward. Too bad that didn't materialize, and I fell yet again in the 9-5 trap - https://farhan3d.github.io/cubemash/cubemash.html

🐔 **Chicken:** Chicken, chicken, and chicken - https://farhan3d.github.io/chicken/chicken.html
