Hi there! I am Farhan, and I like to build applications primarily in the 3D CAD / Games domains. I have worked in the CAD development industry for over a decade as a developer, and the later years transitioned into product management for related software applications. I am currently learning to build web based engineering centric 3D interactive applications, and exploring the Godot engine.
